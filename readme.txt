//How to play:

Your goal is to reach 'X' point on the map.

You can only move in first person mode.

You can check your map to see where you are located, but how many times you can see it depends on chosen difficulty:
1. Easy - Unlimited map openings
2. Normal - 5 map openings
3. Hard - One map opening


//Controls:

Use WASD and Enter to choose difficulty level.
Press Esc if you want to quit or restart the game.
Use AD to rotate and WS to move forward and backward.
Rest is explained in the game.


//Custom maps:

1. If you want to create your own map, just edit or make new .txt file named 'mapa1', 'mapa2' or 'mapa3'.

2. One map should have size of 32x16. That's how I made and tested them, feel free to experiment with that.

3. Use symbols shown below to put objects on map, like walls and spawn point.

 Legend:

+ - Walls
? - Free space (that's how the game is coded, fill free space with question marks)
^ - Spawn point
X - Exit
= - Map boundaries (just make an outline with equation marks)

4. Keep the whole map in ONE LINE, because I was too lazy to program it the other way.

5. Save it in the same folder as app file or overwrite an old one and you're ready to go.


Enjoy!
